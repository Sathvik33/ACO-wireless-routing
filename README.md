# ACO-Wireless-Routing

This project implements Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to find the optimal path in a wireless sensor network modeled as a 2D grid. It simulates ants moving from a source to a destination node based on pheromone trails and path costs.

## How It Works

- Accepts user input for grid dimensions and node values
- Takes source and destination node values
- Ants search for the optimal path using ACO logic
- Outputs the best path and its total cost

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sathvik33/aco-wireless-routing.git
cd aco-wireless-routing
